## About the Project

**Fate Protocol** is a decentralized prediction pool designed to overcome the limitations of traditional systems. It introduces a **perpetual**, **on-chain**, and **permissionless** framework for prediction on the future value of digital assets such as **BTC/USD**, without being bound by expiration dates or centralized intermediaries.

### Problems with Traditional Prediction Markets

Traditional prediction markets suffer from several critical limitations that restrict participation, scalability, and decentralization:

**1. Expiry-Based Constraints**  
Prediction markets traditionally operate with fixed expiration dates. This rigid design limits user engagement to predefined timeframes and prevents ongoing prediction, which is not ideal for continuously evolving markets like cryptocurrencies.

**2. Dependency on Order Books**  
Liquidity in traditional platforms is often managed through order books. This model introduces inefficiencies such as slippage and front-running, especially in low-volume markets. It also relies on active market makers to sustain usability.

**3. Capital Inefficiency**  
Users must often commit large sums of capital that remain locked until market resolution. This inefficiency makes participation costly and discourages frequent engagement, particularly for smaller participants.

**4. Centralized Settlement**  
Most prediction platforms rely on centralized entities or opaque mechanisms to resolve outcomes. This introduces trust assumptions, potential censorship, and single points of failure, undermining the decentralized ethos of blockchain systems.

---

### How Fate Protocol Solves These Challenges

Fate Protocol reimagines the architecture of prediction markets through innovation in design, execution, and resolution:

**1. Perpetual Market Design**  
Fate eliminates fixed expiry dates by introducing continuously running markets. This allows users to enter and exit positions at any time, supporting long-term and short-term predictions alike, much like perpetual futures in traditional finance.

**2. Liquidity Pools Instead of Order Books**  
Rather than using order books, Fate leverages decentralized liquidity pools. This ensures consistent access to liquidity, minimizes slippage, and simplifies the user experience by automating trade matching and execution.

**3. Capital-Efficient Participation**  
Through carefully designed financial primitives and liquidity mechanisms, users can interact with the protocol in a more capital-efficient manner. Funds are dynamically allocated, enabling better utilization and potentially higher returns on capital.

**4. On-Chain, Trustless Settlement**  
All outcomes on Fate are resolved using verifiable on-chain data feeds provided by the [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/). This eliminates reliance on third-party arbiters and ensures transparent, tamper-proof, and censorship-resistant resolution of predictions.
